title: Hello, Markdown!

This is my first blog post using Markdown. This application is built with Next.js, TailwindCSS and Shadcn. The blog posts are stored in Markdown format in the `lib/assets/posts` directory. To render the blog posts, I am using the `marked` library. In build time, markdown files are parsed and converted to HTML.

## Features

- Easy to write
- Supports formatting
- Can include code snippets

## Why Markdown?

It's easy. It's not overly bloated, unlike HTML. Also, as the creator of [markdown] says,

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.
